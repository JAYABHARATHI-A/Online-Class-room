In response to the current situation, educators have been instrumental in finding new ways to ensure learning continues for children by developing online learning materials and platforms; these tools to be able to meet students regularly and conducting mental & social well-being sessions during the start of the school day and at closure. For these purpose we developed or designed online classroom and it has following features and it  supports different functions for both teachers and  students. Online Classroom is a student-teacher portal with various classroom features like uploading assignments, submissions, Class Notice and many more. Students and Teachers can login in the portal and can experience interactive classroom experience online. We developed web page platform with python Django frontend and MySQL backend.
